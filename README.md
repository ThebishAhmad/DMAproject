Rat Race vs Passion
A Data Mining and Analytics Project

This project explores how societal expectations and personal passions shape an individual’s sense of fulfillment. Using real survey data and analytical methods in R, the study investigates the balance between financial stability and personal satisfaction, aiming to understand what drives long-term happiness and career motivation.

Overview

In today’s professional world, many people find themselves in a “rat race” — pursuing financial success and social validation at the cost of personal growth and creativity.
This project compares extrinsic motivators (money, recognition, job security) and intrinsic motivators (passion, purpose, autonomy) through statistical analysis and visual storytelling.

The research reveals how pressure, gender, and academic branch influence whether individuals choose passion or stability — and how these choices affect overall satisfaction.

Objectives

Analyze patterns in motivation, satisfaction, and stress using survey data.

Visualize how “rat race” behaviors differ from passion-driven decisions.

Identify major barriers to pursuing passion such as financial risk, fear of failure, and social expectations.

Propose strategies for integrating passion into sustainable career paths.

Tools and Technologies

R Programming – for statistical computation and visualization

tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr – for data cleaning, manipulation, and graphics

Google Forms Dataset – 126 responses from students across engineering branches

Data Mining and Analytics Lab (NIT Jalandhar)

Key Insights

Around 40% of respondents chose higher salary with lower satisfaction.

Financial concerns and fear of failure are the top barriers to pursuing passion.

Students who prioritize passion report higher enjoyment (avg. 4.0/5) and lower burnout.

External pressures—family and societal expectations—significantly increase feelings of being trapped in the rat race.

A growing subset is already pursuing their passion, signaling a positive cultural shift.
